Welcome to moesbnb! The functionality and essence similarly mimics airbnb. With moesbnb, users are able to create Spots and host their homes, apartments, etc. Users can also view other host's spots. After a spot has been created, users may leave a review of the spot, which can be deleted if the user wishes.

## **Challenges and Future Implementations** ##
Where do I begin! Let's start off by saying I had a week to do this project. On day three, I was fully done, with extra functionality and features, such as a calendar search to view available spots on certain dates. On day four, a very weird bug occured. I'd fix said bug, and then another one popped up, each worse than the last. That took 3 days and many restless hours to fix. Although I fixed the chain of bugs that were destroying the entire functionality of the website, I had to let go of the extra features I implemented, and redesign the website. I am eager to find the extra time to come back to this project, re-add those features, and make this a better constructed website. Always taking the good from the bad, this sharpened my debugging skills, and ultimately made me a better developer.
